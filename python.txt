𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 "𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝗵𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀" 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲: Type hints make it easier to understand the expected types of function arguments and return values. For example, def demo(x: int, y: str, z: float = 100) -> bool:.

𝟮. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗲𝘅𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: Catch specific exceptions to understand what went wrong in the code. Avoid using bare except clause that catches all the exceptions.
For example,
try:
some_code()
except ValueError:
handle_value_error()

𝟯. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 "𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗿𝘀" 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: This ensures that resources such as file handles and database connections are properly managed and closed.
For example, with open("demo.txt", mode="w") as file:

𝟰. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 "𝗲𝗹𝘀𝗲" 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 "𝗳𝗼𝗿" 𝗮𝗻𝗱 "𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲" 𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀: It's the pythonic way of indicating that all items were processed in their natural course.

𝟱. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁.𝗴𝗲𝘁() 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱: It provides a way to avoid errors when a key is not present and allows you to return a default value when the key is not present. For example, my_dict.get('key', default_val).

𝟲. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 "𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲" 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸 𝗳𝗼𝗿 "𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲" 𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: It's the recommended way to compare object types in Python, especially with inherited objects.

𝟳. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 "𝗶𝘀" 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗼𝗻: Use is to check for None, True, and False instead of ==. It checks if the two items reference the same object in memory, while == checks for value equality.

𝟴. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗽, 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁: They provide a concise way of transforming and filtering data in a list. For example, squared = map(lambda x: x*x, [1, 2, 3]).

𝟵. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 "𝗱𝗼𝗰𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀" 𝗮𝗻𝗱 "𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀": Docstrings provide a way to document what a function or module does, as well as its input and output. Single-line comments can also help explain complex expressions.

𝟭𝟬. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 "𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗿 "𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀: Implementing repr allows you to define a string representation for objects. This can be helpful for debugging and logging.

𝟭𝟭. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁: Logging provides a more consistent way of displaying messages, and allows you to filter messages by setting the correct log level.
